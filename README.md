# Mobile Automation Project - login and ticket movie purchase

## Description

This project is based on automated testing of the Cinemark app, which allows me to purchase movie tickets and confectionery. Currently, the entire flow of a ticket purchase is automated.
The project structure uses Screenplay as a framework, using java as a programming language and gradle as a dependency manager, along with Serenity BDD and Cucumber to automate as plugins.

## Project Structure

- `src/main/java`: Contains the application's source code, organized into tasks, user interface, and utilities.
- `src/test/java`: Houses the Cucumber runners and step definitions for the tests.
- `src/test/resources/features`: Directory for Cucumber feature files.
- `target/site/serenity`: Stores the reports generated by Serenity BDD.

## Requirements

- JDK 8 or higher
- Gradle

## Setup

To set up the project, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MarcoMayo/SunDevs_ProjectMOBILE
cd SunDevs_ProjectMOBILE
```

## Running Tests
To run the tests, use the following Gradle command:

```
./gradlew test aggregate
```

This command will execute the tests and generate a report in target/site/serenity/index.html.
